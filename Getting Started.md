# Getting Started
#### After you are done downloading VS Code, go ahead and open it up. At the top left of the home page you will see a button call file. Click on the file button and then select new text file. In order to write the programming language you want you must save the file with the extension of the language you want to use. On the very left side of the screen, you will see a button call extension. This is where you will download extensions such as C++, Python, code runner, etc.
